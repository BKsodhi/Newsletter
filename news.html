                <h2>1. Sinking feeling for Sunak, Downing St for Starmer</h2>
                <p>Change came to the UK on Friday in the form of a Labour landslide under 61-year-old Keir Starmer’s (pic) leadership.</p>
                <p>The Opposition party that was said to be in tatters, needing “at least 10 years to fix”, swept the polls with 410 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>It’s the biggest majority in the British Parliament since at least 1997.</p>
                <p>Just five years ago, Labour had suffered its worst defeat in a century.</p>
                <p>This time, former PM Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives (Tories) have been routed with 118 seats after 14 years in office.</p>
